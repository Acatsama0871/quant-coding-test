# Quant. Finance Coding Test

This should be a straightforward experience for creating a standardized development environment to perform quantiative analysis work. After creating the necessary accounts, it is expected that this work can be completed in under two hours.

## Usage and test structure

To start you will need to create two accounts, in addition to a github account.

1. [gitpod.io](gitpod.io), for the devleopment environment.
2. [IEXcloud.io](https://iexcloud.io/), for the price data.

After you've created the Gitpod account, you can open up the development environment by clicking here:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/wmacmillan/quant-coding-test)

A jupyter notebook server has been automatically spawned when the IDE is launched. You can access it by clicking remote explorer on the left hand side context menu, which will open up the available ports. From there click on the globe icon for port 8888. This will open the server in a tab in your browser. See the screenshot below for the specific icons discussed. The password for the server is `financerocks!`.
